# Guess-the-number game

My first Haskell program ever. Classical program where a player has
to find a number in a range with as less tries as possible. Of course
it is a ln(x)/ln(2) problem.

First usage of:

- cabal tool
- functor operation
- IO type

Lots of IO returning functions, but there is no real point to try having lots
of pure functions in this kind of program.

To run:

    $ cabal run
